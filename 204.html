<P>&lt;F&gt;, the construction area and construction technology </P>
<P>1, the construction area: </P>
<P>(1), the station's cable channel, cable pipe, cable tray, pressure cabinets, terminal boxes, control panel cabinet. </P>
<P>(2), the station's cable channel switch market, terminal boxes, cable pipe. </P>
<P>(3), the station all the cable channel into the interior from the outdoor place. </P>
<P>(4), high-pressure chamber, control building. </P>
<P>2, the construction process: </P>
<P>(1), cable through walls, run cable through the ground at the (high pressure into the outlet holes in the bottom cabinet, cable shafts and cable through the cable tray) large holes in the wall at the fire board with the CS195 + composite shrinkage holes area, so that the distance between the cable and reduce fire to 10mm and then use MP + non-coagulation-fire clay plug the gap, and finally use the 1000 fire sealant help level all the gaps in electricity and fire cut off at the brush 100cm of FD2000 + cable fire retardant paint, to fire insulation, dense smoke, beautiful results . </P>
<P>(2), terminal boxes, control panel cabinets large holes at the available CS195 + composite fire board shrinkage holes area, so cable and fire distance reduced to 10mm and then use MP + non-coagulation-fire clay plug the gap, and finally use the 1000 fire sealant help level all the gaps, small holes directly MP + non-solidified mud plug gap fire, the last use of fire-retardant sealant 1000 Rotary flat all the gaps, to fire, dense smoke, beautiful results. Outdoor terminal block box finished bottom of the cabinet after the FD2000 + cable 100cm brush fire retardant paint, fire insulation to achieve beautiful results. </P>
<P>(3), cable trench at the collation from the outdoors into the interior shape of the cable after the cable using aluminum box made of four weeks (for a fixed time when the fire expanded clay compression), then use self-tapping screw-shaped aluminum bar fixed to the wall surface with the CS195 + composite fire board shrinkage hole area, in the need to replace and increase or decrease the cable position to add 3M easy expansion program to facilitate the re-construction, the gap at the use of MP + non-coagulation-fire clay plug the gap, and finally use CP25WB + solidified flame-retardant mud help level all the gaps to fire, water, anti-small animals into the interior, dense smoke, beautiful effects and easy expansion. </P>
<P>(4), control building of the control panel cabinet bottom as large holes using CS195 + composite fire board shrinkage holes area, so cable and fire distance reduced to 10mm and then use MP + non-coagulation-fire clay plug the gap, and finally use the 1000 fire seals Rotary glue flat all the gaps, such as small holes directly with MP + non-solidified mud plug gap fire, and finally use the 1000 fire sealant level all the gaps to help fire, dense smoke, beautiful results. </P>
<P>3, site planning and construction period: </P>
