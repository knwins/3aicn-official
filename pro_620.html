<P> 3M Fire cement mortar is a lightweight fire-resistant sealing materials, paper packaging bag with a polymer, when used with the mixing water. 3M Fire plaster does not contain man-made mineral fibers, and asbestos, at the same time, they do not contain fiber gasket material. 3M adhesive mortar fire free Portland (Portland) cement, the Portland cement binder, with the same compared to the negative effects of concrete more resistant to impact. 3M Fire plaster is mainly used in mechanical, electrical facilities, electrical fire at the block hole. </ P> 
<P> <STRONG> 3M fire mortar product features </ STRONG> </ P> 
<P> 1. Mix a variety of choices: to be self-leveling type and non-sag consistency of application, thus saving labor. <BR> 2. Excellent adhesion: bonds to concrete, metal, wood, plastic and cable sheathing. <BR> 3. Without power tools can be re-perforation: the cable can easily change the location to save maintenance costs. <BR> 4. Self-adhesive: This feature has been tested before and during the fire was confirmed. <BR> 5. Does not contain man-made fibers and asbestos. <BR> 6. With enhanced polypropylene fiber: high temperature in the solidification and reduce cracking. <BR> 7. Pumpability: to ensure rapid construction, resulting in large savings in labor and project duration. <BR> 8. In the different channels within the sheath thickness test done (up to 15 cm). <BR> 9. An excellent absorber of: things can be well absorbed through the fire's heat, reduce the fire in the back surface of the possibility of ignition of combustible materials. <BR> 10. Compressive strength: between 1.3--5.45N/MM2 between the different water-cement ratio due to corresponding changes in (a unit of weight of water than the 2.5 to 4 weight unit of cement ). <BR> 11. In the size of 91cm x 15cm of cable tray openings been tested, 1C1000MCM and other cable, the maximum cable fill rate of 45% (visual 100%). <BR> 12. In the size of 91cm x 15cm of aluminum, galvanized steel ladder-type tests done at the bridge opening. <BR> 13. Hanging on with copper or aluminum bus bars 4500A test done at the pipe opening. <BR> 14.

<P> 1. Learning familiar with the local health systems and site safety requirements, including the government and plant safety manual <BR> 2. Sweep through the hole and the material to remove dirt, dust, debris, etc. will impact through material objects and Mortar normal bond, and through the hole on both sides of 60cm throughout the range of no help tie things on, so that the proper use of Mortar can meet the requirements specification to prevent the spread of smoke. <BR> 3. When necessary, be fitted with cushioning material (for example: hole larger than 20cmx20cm). Cardboard such as polystyrene Styrofoam SMTM (DOW Chemical Company) or Thermax (produced by the Celotex Corporation), minimum thickness 38mm. In addition to using Thermax, all of the foam board Mortar must be removed after hardening. Foam board bonded by friction instead of fasteners fixed in plaster, when the mortar mix is ??greater than 1:3, the liner can have openings and mortar will not drip. <BR> 4. With 5cm wide masking tape through things, when this step is ignored, it will be added to open a small amount of plaster to fill holes outside. After the plaster will absorb moisture and shrink quickly. But will leave the holes around the hairline cracks, which is normal and will not affect the adhesion of plaster. <BR> 5. According to the following installation instructions mixing plaster <BR> 6. Wet with spray gun or brush around the open hole. For the open hole in the wall to the surrounding moist prevent the plaster of premature <BR> 7. Will be filled with plaster in the most difficult construction site (for example: cable bundle of internal voids) <BR> Note: The small amount of plaster to fill in these areas to avoid other parts of the hardening of the material first, if After filling in the cable bundle, open is no longer wet the surrounding holes, in accordance with the above points before proceeding. <BR> 8. To open the compressed plaster around the hole, we must face towards the bonding operation. </ P> 
<P> <STRONG> Step trap occurs after the correction </ STRONG> </ P> 
<P> Near the wall when open hole, if the plaster becomes unstable, a small amount of dry plaster added to it. Mortar will harden faster. If the plaster had collapsed, and with the open hole at the top of the formation of a gap with a trowel to open every triangle to expand this gap, re-adjust until the plaster hardened after a period of time, then add the dry plaster fills the gap closed. </ P> 
<P> 9. Smooth surface on the plaster to the wall or floor surface and flush, </ P> 
<P> Note: 1) use a variety of trowels. <BR> 2) 3M rapid hardening mortar fire, hardening time, mainly by air conditions, and on-site concrete similarity, the more hot air drier, hardened plaster will shrink faster will be more. Construction to minimize the environmental impact can be covered in plaster to protect the fire protective layer of plastic block. <BR> 3). In smooth rapidly removed after the masking tape. </ P> 
<P> <STRONG> Fire mortar mixing guide </ STRONG> </ P> 
<P> 1. First added to the bucket of water, and then the plaster with an awl into the bucket (awl larger, into the slower the better). <BR> Mixing ratio of 1 unit of water than 2.5 units (weight) of the plaster to 1 unit of water than 4 units of plaster. When the mortar filled with hand tools to the real wall openings, the ratio of 1:3.5 is more appropriate. Hardening time will affect the consistency, more water ratio (eg 1:2.8) in a long time to achieve sufficient coagulation. <BR> 2. To avoid the end of the proportional value. When water consumption is low, the corresponding fixtures use less. When the water is higher, will have a strong self-leveling concentration. <BR> 3. At least 5 minutes to mixing mortar evenly smooth. Note barrel at the bottom and around the dry plaster particles. <BR> 4. Do not second mixing </ P> 
<P> <IMG Src="/manage/edit/uploadfile/2011619221423502.gif" border=0> </ P> 
<P> <STRONG> Note: </ STRONG> <BR> 1) mortar fire in the wet state that can conduct electricity, so do not install the cable with exposed wires touch. When the situation is more complex, you can ask an electrical engineer. <BR> 2) When there are cracks on the wall or floor, it must be on crack and joint sealing systems set the displacement, or may extend to cracks in the system at the block. Can tap to determine the crack towards. When run through the material, it can be judged by the same way crack. When there are more serious cracks, the coating can be used to avoid the sticky end of the deficiencies. <BR> 3) fire clay mortar and CP25WB + can play with the use of dense smoke effect. <BR> 4) Do not apply the plaster on the active pipeline, usually insulated pipe will be activities, a 3mm thick quality paper to ceramic coated pipes, which can prevent cracks caused due to pipeline activities. Do not block out material coated on both sides. <BR> 5) This is not load-bearing mortar fire, please refer to product characteristics in the compressive strength. Existing specifications do not have a fire blocking material can be load-bearing requirements. </ P> 
<P> <STRONG> Maintenance </ STRONG> </ P> 
<P> 3M mortar can fire indefinitely under normal conditions of use, but would harm the product to avoid the negative effects of the concrete (such as sulfur, bleach). </ P>
